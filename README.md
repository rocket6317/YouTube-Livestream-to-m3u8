# 🎬 YouTube Livestream Redirector

A lightweight Flask-based service that extracts a YouTube livestream .m3u8 HLS URL and serves it in a way that IPTV players (like OTT Navigator, TiviMate, VLC) can consume — with smart caching.

See my other repository for a performance-optimized version — it periodically caches and serves links from memory.
